# ML-CampusX-Notes
# üß† ML CampusX Notes - Sumit Pagar

This repository contains my hands-on learning journey from the [CampusX Machine Learning Course](https://www.youtube.com/@CampusX) ‚Äî an in-depth series taught by our legend mentor.  
I‚Äôm solving real-world problems with code + concepts, and these notes are my clean reference with examples and implementation.

## üìö Structure

All notebooks are organized inside the [`Notebooks/`](./Notebooks) folder. Each file represents a core concept from ML with code and explanations.
